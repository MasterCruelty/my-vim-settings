# my-vim-settings
A few settings I use on vim.

If you want to use these options, just modify .vimrc with your current path <code>/home/user/my-vim-settings/setting.vim</code> and put it in <code>/home/user/</code>
Windows users: you have to put the .vimrc file in this path after vim is installed: <code>C:\users\-user-\vimfiles\.vimrc</code>
